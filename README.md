### Important Notes:

1. For production deployment:
   - Set `DEBUG=False`
   - Set `PROD=True`
   - Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is a strong, unique value
   - Configure `MORE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` with your server IPs/domains

2. Email Configuration:
   - `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` and `EMAIL_HOST_USER` are typically the same
   - Ensure `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` is secure and properly configured

3. Database Configuration:
   - When using Docker, `DB_HOST` should be set to `db`
   - Ensure `DB_PASSWORD` is strong and secure

4. Payment Gateway:
   - `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is required for processing payments
   - Keep this key secure and never commit it to version control

## Note

- In addition to turning Debug=False, you also need to set Prod=True in the env vars
