### Important Notes:

1. For production deployment:
   - Set `DEBUG=False`
   - Set `PROD=True`
   - Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is a strong, unique value
   - Configure `MORE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` with your server IPs/domains

2. Email Configuration:
   - `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` and `EMAIL_HOST_USER` are typically the same
   - Ensure `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` is secure and properly configured

3. Database Configuration:
   - When using Docker, `DB_HOST` should be set to `db`
   - Ensure `DB_PASSWORD` is strong and secure

4. Payment Gateway:
   - `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is required for processing payments
   - Keep this key secure and never commit it to version control

## Note

- In addition to turning Debug=False, you also need to set Prod=True in the env vars

Other than extensively refering to the Django documentation, I found these articles really helpful.

### Coolify using Dockerfile

Coolify supports docker-compose also, but as of writing this, docker compose deployments are unstable, and cause gateway timeout issues due to improper configuration in the proxy.

Using Dockerfile as deployment method is recommended in Coolify.

First of all deploy a Postgres instance on coolify and make it publicly accessible. Obviously set a very long password. Making the db accessible over internet can help you debug from local machine, and also  coolify has some issues with resolving internal addresses when put in env vars. Once the db is deployed copy the values for db host, username, pass and port.


Now deploy the actual app via Dockerfile, and set all the environment variables properly.


Some important settings to be performed from coolify GUI

- **General** tab --> **Network** section --> Port exposes: 8000
- Setup the domains, and add them to apt env vars `MORE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `PROD`
- **Storages** tab --> Add --> Volume mount
  - source: a suitable path in your host filesystem
  - dest: `/data` (if you change this, you need to change `PROD_FILES_ROOT`)
To persist static data between deployments, setup a
